HPCL Direct Sales – Product Intelligence (Summary Doc)
Purpose:
 This document summarizes HPCL’s Direct Sales product portfolio with a strict focus on products, target industries, buying signals, and recommendation logic. It is designed to support the development of a B2B Lead Intelligence Agent for the Productathon.
________________


1. Objective of This Intelligence
* Identify which HPCL product to pitch

* Detect buying intent signals from public data (tenders, news, websites)

* Map industry → product → confidence score

* Enable explainable product recommendations

4. Signal Taxonomy (What the Agent Detects)
1. Explicit Procurement Signals (High Confidence)
   * Tenders

   * EOIs

   * RFQs

Examples:
 "Tender for supply of HSD"
 "Procurement of Food Grade Hexane"
________________


2. Implicit Demand Signals (Medium Confidence)
      * Capacity expansion

      * New plant / boiler / kiln

      * New road or port project

Examples:
 "Company announces 20 MW captive power expansion"
 "New solvent extraction unit announced"
________________


3. Operational Signals (Low–Medium Confidence)
         * Company profile info

         * Fleet size

         * Industry listing

Examples:
 "Manufacturer of industrial paints"
 "Operates 200+ trucks"
________________


5. Product Recommendation Logic (Explainable)
Step-by-Step Flow
            1. Extract keywords from text

            2. Identify industry

            3. Map industry → HPCL product

            4. Apply heuristics

            5. Output Top-3 products + confidence

________________


Scoring Heuristics
               * Explicit tender > expansion news > static profile

               * Recent signal scores higher

               * Larger company = higher volume potential

6. Sample Recommendation Output (Agent Style)
Detected Signal:
“Tender for supply of Food Grade Hexane for Solvent Extraction Plant”
Recommended Products:
                  1. Hexane (Food Grade) – Primary match

                  2. MTO – Maintenance & cleaning

                  3. HSD – DG sets & logistics

Confidence: 90+
Reason: Explicit tender + industry match + recurring demand

7. Why This Matters for Productathon
                     * Clean signal → product mapping

                     * Fully rule-based & explainable

                     * Works with news, tenders, websites

                     * No dependency on private data

                     * Easy to convert into agent prompts / pipelines
